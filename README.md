cvPlay
======

Reason d'etre
-------------
cvPlay shows my experimentation as I learn enough openCV to impliment a distance finder.
The best example of this is Mssrs. Tuohy, Cualain, Jones, and Glavin paper, ["Distance Determination for an Automobile Environment using Inverse Perspective Mapping in OpenCV"](http://shanetuohy.com/fyp/Images/issc.pdf)
Experiments in computer vision.      

Building
--------
cvPlay required openCV. Installing openCV is easy with Homebrew
```
	brew install opencv
	cmake .
	make
```
