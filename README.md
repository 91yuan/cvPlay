cvPlay
======

Reason d'etre
-------------
cvPlay shows my experimentation as I learn enough openCV to impliment a distance finder.
The best example of this is Mssrs. Tuohy, Cualain, Jones, and Glavin paper, ["Distance Determination for an Automobile Environment using Inverse Perspective Mapping in OpenCV"][paper]
Experiments in computer vision.      

Building
--------
cvPlay required openCV. Installing openCV is easy with Homebrew
	brew install opencv
	cmake .
	make
